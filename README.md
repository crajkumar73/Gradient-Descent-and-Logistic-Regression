# Topic 3: Gradient-Descent-and-Logistic-Regression

This topic focuses on training models anchored in regression. I developed several variations of regression-based learning models, learning the suitability of each for a given learning task. The objectives were to build statistical models for supervised learning, develop gradient descent models and to develop polynomial and logistic regression models.
